 *    for all four function prototypes.
 *
 *    cplx_add probably has the most convenient interface, because it
 *    lets you write things like
 *
 *       w = cplx_add( z1, cplx_add(z2, z3) );
 *
 *    On the other hand, cplx_multiply probably has the most efficient
 *    interface, because it eliminates any copying of structs.
